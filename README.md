# AI-Search-Music-Player
AI-Enhanced Music Player (Python, Tkinter, VLC, Speech Recognition)

This project is a feature-rich desktop music player developed using Python's Tkinter GUI library combined with VLC media player integration, speech recognition, and YouTube-based AI song search. It allows users to play local audio files (MP3, WAV, FLAC, etc.) with standard playback controls like play, pause, stop, next, and previous. The app maintains a persistent playlist using JSON, supports progress tracking with seek functionality, and displays real-time track metadata using the Mutagen library.

A key innovation is the AI Search section, where users can search for songs either via text input or voice command, powered by the SpeechRecognition module and YouTube search using yt_dlp. Users can stream music directly from YouTube without downloading, making it highly dynamic. The interface is designed with a modern, dark theme for better user experience.

Multithreading ensures smooth UI updates and uninterrupted playback. This intelligent player combines local file handling, online streaming, and AI-powered search, showcasing integration of multiple Python modules in a cohesive, user-friendly application suitable for real-time media interaction.
